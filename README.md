# covid19-variants

This repository collects data on COVID-19 variants as provided by RKI. 

In the beginning, those numbers were only listed in PDF reports published [here](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/DESH/Berichte-VOC-tab.html).

As of 2021-06-23 these have been published as an excel file [here](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Daten/VOC_VOI_Tabelle.html).

As we are mainly interested in the Delta variant, the data provided here starts with the report published at 2021-05-12, which contains the first occurence of the Delta variant.
